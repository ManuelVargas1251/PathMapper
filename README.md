# Path Mapper
CSCE 4901 - Software Development Project

##Introduction

We are creating an android mobile application that creates a map of walkable locations that services like Google Maps have not charted before, such as campuses, theme parks, etc. Once these places have been charted, the application can provide paths from location to location to anyone who visits the previously mapped area. 

The application will utilize the mobile phone’s location to create paths that users can submit; using graph theory, paths will eventually be built to create a working map of the locations. Once these maps have been built, our algorithm will find the shortest walkable distance and help the user arrive at their destination.

We’ve created this as a part of a senior school project to help us understand the project process of creating a product/service as we would in any real world work environment. This will help us understand and experience project planning, design, management and finally, project completion. Aside from the logistical work listed above, we will be delving into a variety of new ways to make the actual program such as languages, environments, and implementations.
